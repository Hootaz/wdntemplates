<h5>Browser Upgrade Recommended</h5>
<p>
Hello.</p>
<p>
We notice that you're using Internet Explorer 6 as your preferred browser.</p>
<p>
Internet Explorer 8 is the latest version of this browser, and Microsoft recommends upgrading for several reasons. The latest product is more stable and enables users to be more secure and productive when performing their work or browsing the Internet. The newest version also partners more closely with Web standards working groups to be a key contributor in Web standards evolution. All of these reasons make for a better web experience.</p>
<p>
For more information and to upgrade, visit the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/" title="Internet Explorer 8 download center">Internet Explorer 8 download center</a>.
